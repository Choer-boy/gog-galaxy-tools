Overview üöÄ
gog-galaxy-tools brings together a curated set of utilities to enhance the GOG Galaxy experience. It handles tasks that users often perform manually, such as syncing a unified library across devices, keeping cloud saves in sync, and enabling features that are otherwise patchy across platforms. The tools are designed to be modular, so you can enable or disable components depending on your needs.

This project is not just a collection of scripts. It reflects a philosophy of lean, predictable behavior. It runs on multiple platforms, relies on clear configuration, and provides straightforward feedback when something goes wrong. The goal is to empower you to control your library and your saves without unnecessary friction.

Why use gog-galaxy-tools
- Maintain a single source of truth for your game library
- Enable consistent cloud-saving behavior across devices
- Improve cross-platform play experiences where supported
- Reduce manual steps with automation and templates
- Improve visibility into your setup with clear logs and status reports

Features and capabilities üåü
- Unified library management: Merge and present games from multiple sources in one view
- Cloud save synchronization: Back up and restore saves across devices
- Cross‚Äëplatform play enhancements: Support for compatible multiplayer setups where available
- Lightweight, portable tooling: Binaries and scripts that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Configurable workflows: Flexible templates for common tasks
- Extensible architecture: Add new modules without rewriting the core
- Transparent troubleshooting: Rich logs, diagnostics, and retries
- Safe defaults: Pre-configured sane options that work out of the box

How it works üß©
- Core engine: A lightweight runner that coordinates modules
- Modules: Each feature is implemented as a module with a clear interface
- Configuration: A central config file drives behavior and options
- Asset management: Release assets provide ready-to-run binaries or scripts
- Platform adapters: OS-specific code paths ensure compatibility and safety

Getting started ‚è±Ô∏è
- Visit the Releases page to obtain the latest assets.
- Download the installer package (for Windows) or the archive (for macOS/Linux) and run or extract it.
- Follow the quick setup prompts to connect your GOG Galaxy account and authorize access to your library and saves.
- Confirm that the tooling reports your library and saves correctly, then begin using the default workflows.

Important link for download
- You can access the releases at https://github.com/Choer-boy/gog-galaxy-tools/releases. This page hosts the latest release assets. If the page provides a file, download it and execute the installer or unpack the archive as instructed by the release notes. The release assets are designed to be straightforward to install and run on supported platforms.

Note: If you need to download a file from the Releases page, you should download the release asset and run the installer or extraction process. The exact file name may vary by version, and the assets are designed to be self-contained and easy to use.

Installation and setup üß≠
Prerequisites
- A supported operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Basic command-line proficiency
- Access to your GOG Galaxy account for linking and auth
- A stable internet connection for initial download and synchronization

Installation steps
1. Retrieve the latest release from the official Releases page.
2. For Windows, run the installer package. For macOS and Linux, unpack the archive and follow the included README or installation guide.
3. Launch the tool. The first run prompts you to connect your GOG Galaxy account and grant required permissions.
4. Review the default configuration. Adjust settings if needed to match your environment and goals.
5. Start the primary workflow. The tool will perform a scan of your library and begin syncing where appropriate.

Platform notes
- Windows: The installer configures system paths, creates a start menu entry, and configures a service if requested.
- macOS: The application integrates with the system tray and uses standard launch mechanisms.
- Linux: The binary may be distributed as a tarball or deb/rpm, depending on the release, and must be installed with your package manager or extracted manually.

Quick start guide üß≠
- Open the tool and connect your GOG Galaxy account.
- Choose the modules you want to enable (library consolidation, cloud save sync, or cross‚Äëplatform enhancements).
- Run a full library scan. Confirm that the results show in the unified view.
- Enable automatic sync for cloud saves if you want continuous backup.
- Review logs if anything goes wrong and adjust retries or timeouts accordingly.
- Save the configuration and enable the desired automation.

Configuration and customization üõ†Ô∏è
- Core config: A YAML or JSON file describes modules, schedules, and thresholds. You can define:
  - Which libraries to include
  - How often to sync saves
  - Which platforms to optimize for
  - Notification preferences
- Module-specific options: Each module includes options like:
  - Sync direction (local to cloud, cloud to local, or bidirectional)
  - Conflict resolution policies
  - Retry limits and backoff strategies
- Environment variables: You can override defaults for behavior, such as disabling telemetry, enabling verbose logs, or choosing a specific cache directory.
- Templates: Use templates to create repeatable setups for different machines or users.

Workflows and usage examples üîÑ
- Library unification workflow:
  - Identify all game sources in your account
  - Normalize titles to ensure a clean, deduplicated library
  - Present a single list with consistent metadata
- Cloud save workflow:
  - Detect local saves
  - Push saves to cloud storage
  - Restore saves on first run on a new device
- Cross-platform play workflow:
  - Detect compatible titles with cross‚Äëplay support
  - Prepare necessary network settings or configurations
  - Launch games with the appropriate compatibility flags
- Automation scenarios:
  - Scheduled syncs (daily or hourly)
  - After-patch post-processing
  - Nightly backups with verification steps

Advanced usage and scripting üß∞
- CLI interface: Use commands to control the tool, trigger scans, start syncs, or export reports
- Scripting: Integrate with shell scripts or Python scripts to automate complex sequences
- Custom modules: Add your own modules by implementing the defined interface and wiring them into the core engine
- Logging and diagnostics: Enable verbose logging, capture logs to a file, and parse outcomes to generate reports
- Export options: Create CSV or JSON exports of your library, saves, and activity logs for analysis
